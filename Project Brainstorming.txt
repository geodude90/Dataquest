Project Brainstorming:
1. Proprietary to employer
a. Seeking to obtain corporate permission to share slides and code. TBD.
2. Public datasets
a. How does recurrent flooding impact home prices?
i. Tie to federal subsidized flood insurance?
ii. Create a curve estimating decrease in home values from some base line due to sea level rise throughout the century
b. Do fines (traffic stops etc) increase after a recession?
i. Try to determine if local governments use fines as a stop-gap in funding
ii. Shift tax burden to lower incomes
c. What type of congressional re-districting leads to best outcomes?
i. Competitive elections? 
ii. Less-competitive
1. Grouping by communities (California, technocratic)
2. Gerrymandered (Wisconsin, political)
iii. Might have difficulty getting this data, defining outcomes, and showing causal link between voting and districting
